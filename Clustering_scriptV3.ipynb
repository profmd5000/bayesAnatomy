    "What it does:\n",
    "Filters to features with p < 0.05, computes cluster means for those features, prints a preview, and saves the full table.\n",

    "Key operations (visible fragments):\n",

    "Why it matters:\n",
    "This is the artifact you use to name clusters (“sedentary baseline,” “balanced active,” “elite/outlier”), and to report what defines each one."
